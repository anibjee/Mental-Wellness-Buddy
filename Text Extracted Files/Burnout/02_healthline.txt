A Guide to Burnout
Burnout can happen to anyone routinely exposed to high levels of stress, whether work-related or not. It can cause symptoms of exhaustion, depression, and isolation.
Coined by the psychologist, Herbert Freudenberger in the 1970s , burnout describes a severe stress condition that leads to physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion.
Much worse than ordinary fatigue, burnout makes it challenging for people to cope with stress and handle day-to-day responsibilities.
People experiencing burnout often feel like they have nothing left to give and may dread getting out of bed each morning. They may even adopt a pessimistic outlook toward life and feel hopeless.
Burnout doesn’t go away on its own and, if left untreated, it can lead to serious physical and psychological illnesses like depression, heart disease, and diabetes.
Here’s how to manage burnout and identify symptoms.
How to prevent burnout
If you’re constantly juggling work, family, and other responsibilities, finding time for self-care can feel impossible. However, it’s crucial to incorporate stress-reducing habits into your day to prevent burnout. Here are some actionable ways to integrate these tips into even the busiest of schedules:
Move your body, even for just a few minutes
You don’t need a gym membership or an hour-long workout to reap the benefits of exercise. The key is consistency and making small, manageable changes to your routine.
Here are some practical tips :
Morning stretching routine: Start your day with a 5 to 10 minute stretching routine to wake up your body and get your blood flowing. You can do this right after getting out of bed or before you start your morning tasks.
Quick walks: If you’re short on time, take a 10 to 15-minute walk during your lunch break or after dinner. Walking around the block or to the nearest park can help clear your mind and reset your energy levels.
Active breaks: Set a timer every hour to get up and stretch or walk around for a few minutes . Simple activities like walking up and down stairs, doing jumping jacks, or squats in your living room or office can keep your energy levels up and prevent the physical effects of sitting all day.
Nourish your body on the go
When you’re busy, it’s easy to fall into the trap of grabbing unhealthy snacks or skipping meals altogether. However, eating well doesn’t have to be time consuming or complicated. Here’s how to incorporate healthier eating into a busy schedule:
Prep in advance: Set aside some time on the weekend or a free evening to prepare simple meals for the week. Make large batches of things like salads, grain bowls, or smoothie packs that you can easily grab when you’re in a rush.
Smart snacks: Keep a stash of healthy snacks (like nuts, yogurt, or protein bars ) at work or in your car for when you’re feeling hungry between meals. These can help curb cravings without reaching for processed foods or sugary options.
Meal substitutes: If you’re really pressed for time, opt for a quick and healthy smoothie with spinach, berries, protein powder, and chia seed. You can even keep frozen fruits and veggies on hand for easy blending. This can give you a balanced, nutrient-packed meal in just a few minutes.
Prioritize sleep
Adequate sleep is one of the most important factors in preventing burnout. However, when your schedule is packed, it’s easy to sacrifice sleep. Here’s how to prioritize rest without cutting into your already packed schedule:
Set a consistent bedtime: Even if it’s hard to go to bed early, commit to getting a set number of hours of sleep each night (aim for 7 to 8 hours ). Consistency is key. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends.
Wind-down routine: Create a calming bedtime ritual that doesn’t require extra time. For example, read a book, listen to calming music, or take a few minutes to meditate or do deep breathing exercises before bed. This can signal to your brain that it’s time to relax and prepare for sleep.
Limit screen time: Reduce screen time (phones, computers, TV) at least 30 minutes before bed. The blue light emitted from devices can interfere with your body’s natural sleep cycle. Instead, opt for tech-free activities like journaling or reading a physical book.
Ask for help
When you’re feeling overwhelmed, asking for help can feel daunting, but it’s essential for maintaining balance . Here’s how to make it easier:
Set up a support system: Create a “check-in” system with a close friend or family member. Set aside a few minutes each week to talk about what’s stressing you out, or even just to vent. This can help prevent feelings of isolation and give you a regular outlet to process stress.
Delegate tasks: Look for opportunities to delegate responsibilities at work or at home. Can your partner take on a few extra household chores? Can you ask a co-worker for help with a project? Don’t hesitate to ask for help — whether it’s a one-time favor or ongoing support.
Use technology to your advantage: Set reminders on your phone for self-care tasks like drinking water, standing up every hour, or getting a quick workout in. You can also use meal delivery services or grocery delivery to save time and reduce stress.
What are the signs of burnout?
Worried that you may be experiencing burnout but unsure of the signs? We’ve compiled a list of symptoms that you can use as a guide.
Exhaustion: Feeling physically and emotionally depleted. Physical symptoms may include headaches, stomachaches, and appetite or sleep changes.
Isolation: People with burnout tend to feel overwhelmed. As a result, they may stop socializing and confiding in friends, family members, and co-workers.
Escape fantasies: Dissatisfied with the never-ending demands of their jobs, people with burnout may fantasize about running away or going on a solo vacation. In extreme cases, they may turn to drugs, alcohol, or food as a way to numb their emotional pain.
Irritability: Burnout can cause people to lose their cool with friends, co-workers, and family members more easily. Coping with typical stressors like preparing for a work meeting, driving kids to school, and tending to household tasks may also start to feel insurmountable, especially when things don’t go as planned.
Frequent illnesses: Burnout, like other long-term stress, can lower your immune system, making you more susceptible to colds, the flu, and insomnia. Burnout can also lead to mental health concerns like depression and anxiety.
How to recognize burnout early
Unlike a cold or the flu, burnout doesn’t hit all at once.
Psychologists Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North have outlined the 12 phases of this stress syndrome:
Excessive drive/ambition: Common for people starting a new job or undertaking a novel task, too much ambition can lead to burnout.
Pushing yourself to work harder: Ambition pushes you to work harder.
Neglecting your own needs: You begin to sacrifice self-care, like sleep, exercise, and eating well.
Displacement of conflict: Instead of acknowledging that you’re pushing yourself to the max, you blame your boss, the demands of your job, or colleagues for your troubles.
No time for nonwork-related needs: Your values are revised. Work becomes the sole focus at the expense of family, friends, and hobbies, which now seem irrelevant.
Denial: Impatience with those around you mounts. Instead of taking responsibility for your behaviors, you blame others, seeing them as incompetent, lazy, and overbearing.
Withdrawal: You begin to withdraw from family and friends. You lack direction and are cynical. Social invitations to parties, movies, and dinner dates start to feel burdensome instead of enjoyable.
Behavioral changes: Those on the road to burnout may become more aggressive and snap at loved ones for no reason.
Depersonalization: Feeling detached from your life and your ability to control your life.
Inner emptiness or anxiety: Feeling empty or anxious. You may turn to thrill-seeking behaviors to cope with this emotion, such as substance use, gambling, or overeating.
Depression: Life loses its meaning, and you begin to feel hopeless.
Mental or physical collapse: This can impact your ability to cope. Mental health or medical attention may be necessary.
How to help friends or family members
How can you help someone experiencing burnout? While you can’t take away someone’s stress, offering support can help lighten their emotional load.
Listen
Before jumping into “fixing” mode, offer to listen to your friend or family member’s difficulties.
Having someone to talk with can make a world of difference. Often, people need someone to witness their stress and overwhelm, and listening can go a long way.
Validate feelings and concerns
When friends and family members are feeling the effects of burnout, saying “It doesn’t sound that bad” or “I’m sure things will get better” — while meant to offer reassurance — can feel invalidating if someone is really feeling low and hopeless.
Instead, offer validation by saying, “You’ve been working so hard, I can understand why you feel depleted.”
Offer specific types of help
Individuals who are burnt out are often too tired to think of ways that others can help them. Instead of asking, “How can I help?” offer to drop off a meal, pick up dry cleaning, or do a load of laundry.
Kind gestures
Sending flowers, a thoughtful text message, or a written card can remind friends and family members that they’re not alone.
Because they’re often working long hours, people with burnout can feel lonely and underappreciated. But small gestures of kindness can be nurturing.
Research resources
If friends or family members need additional support, such as child care, a house cleaner, or a psychotherapist, offer to research and crowdsource specific resources to help ease the stress.
Takeaway
Burnout doesn’t have to be inevitable. By staying proactive with self-care habits like exercise, sleep, and healthy eating, you can prevent it from taking hold.
Make time for small joys each day — whether it’s a walk, a chat with a friend, or watching a funny show — to keep stress in check.
If you’re supporting someone else through burnout, your listening ear and small acts of kindness can go a long way in helping them feel supported and seen.
Remember, even in the busiest times, taking care of yourself and asking for help can prevent burnout and help you stay balanced, energized, and connected.
