What Does 'Body Image' Mean?
Body image refers to the perception and attitudes you have about your physical appearance. It encompasses how you see yourself, how you feel about your looks, and how you believe others perceive you.
Body image plays a significant role in your overall mental and physical health.
Understanding the different types of body image can help you recognize and address your perceptions and attitudes toward your body.
What does it mean to have a positive body image?
Positive body image means having a clear and accurate perception of your body and feeling comfortable and confident in your own skin. You appreciate your body for what it can do and feel satisfied with your appearance.

confidence in your appearance

What does it mean to have a negative body image?
Negative body image involves a distorted perception of your body and feeling dissatisfied or ashamed of your appearance. It can lead to constant self-criticism and comparison with others.
Characteristics of a negative body image include:
frequent body checking
constant comparison with others
constant validation-seeking
feeling shame or anxiety about your appearance
avoiding social situations due to body dissatisfaction
going to extreme lengths to change your appearance
Having a negative body image doesn’t make you a superficial or bad person. But it can take its toll on your mental health.
If your body image is negatively impacting your well-being, consider reaching out to a therapist or joining a support group, such as through the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) or Sister Circle by Therapy for Black Girls .
Neutral body image, or body neutrality , focuses on what your body can do rather than how it looks. It emphasizes focusing on your body’s abilities and nonphysical characteristics over your appearance.
If you have a negative body image, body neutrality might be easier to attain than a positive body image.
Characteristics of body neutrality:
viewing the body as a tool for living rather than an object to be judged
focusing on caring for your health and well-being
reducing the emphasis on physical appearance
appreciating your body even if you don’t feel attractive
accepting your body even if you struggle to “love” it

What factors can influence your body image?
According to research , several factors can shape and influence your body image.
Media
Exposure to idealized body standards in media and social media can lead to unrealistic expectations and body dissatisfaction.
However, the media can also promote body neutrality or body positivity. For example, body-positive social media content has the potential to improve body image.
Cultural and societal standards
Cultural norms and societal pressures can dictate what is considered attractive, influencing body image.
Family and peer influences
Family attitudes and peer comments about appearance can affect how you perceive your body.
Research shows that family-based weight stigma can contribute to negative body image and less favorable mental health. For example, your family frequently criticizing or teasing you because of your body weight.
Experiences such as bullying and abuse can shape body image. A 2012 study linked childhood trauma and sexual abuse to negative body image.
Mental health
Certain mental health conditions are closely linked to body image issues.
These conditions include:
Anxiety disorders
Depressive disorders
Certain eating disorders
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
Getting mental health treatment may help improve your body image.
Identity
While anybody can experience negative body image, LGBTQ+ people are more likely to develop difficulties with body image and disordered eating, according to the NEDA .
NEDA also notes that gender is also a factor . Women are more likely to experience negative body image than men.
How does your body image affect your overall health and wellness?
Your body image can significantly affect your overall health and wellness in various ways.
Mental health
Negative body image is associated with mental health issues such as eating and mood disorders. It can lead to low self-esteem.
Physical health
Body image concerns can lead to potentially harmful behaviors, such as excessive dieting and overexercising.
You may also neglect to care for your body. For example, this could involve avoiding things like eating well, resting, or getting medical help when necessary.
Social well-being
Negative body image could result in social isolation. You may avoid social interactions because of shame, fear, or embarrassment about your appearance.
Conversely, positive body image contributes to a higher quality of life, promoting self-confidence, resilience, and healthy relationships with others and oneself.
How do you build and maintain a healthy body image?
There are several strategies for building a healthy body image.
Practice self-compassion
Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, especially when facing body image challenges. Focus on your strengths and positive attributes.
Identify and challenge negative thoughts about your body. Replace them with more realistic and positive affirmations, such as “I am grateful that my body lets me do the hobbies I enjoy” or “I am thankful for my health.”
If you find it hard to accept or love your physical traits, try to appreciate your body for what it can do rather than how it looks.
Limit media exposure
Be mindful of your media consumption. Consider following body-positive social media accounts and limiting your exposure to unrealistic body standards. Avoid following accounts that make you feel conscious about your appearance.
A recent study found that participants who reduced their social media usage experienced improvements in their body image within just a few weeks.
