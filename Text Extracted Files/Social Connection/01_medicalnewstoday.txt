Making friends online
Social networks such as Facebook allow people to connect with people they know in real life. They may also help reconnect people with old friends or people they went to school with.
A person may also find Facebook groups to join that are relevant to their interests. They may want to chat with other people in these groups. Additionally, Facebook groups may set up in-person events.
Discord is another app that allows people from all over the world to connect with each other. A person may find a Discord group that connects them with people in their area. Alternatively, there are Discord groups for people who prefer to chat online only.

Staying safe online
Joining a social network or app can be a good way to make new friends. However, a person should take steps to stay safe when speaking with people online that they do not know.
A person should avoid sharing their personal information, such as their phone number or address, with someone they do not know well.
Additionally, a person should take precautions when meeting up in person with someone they met online. RAINN notes that a person should follow these precautions when meeting someone they met online in person:
video chat before meeting
tell a friend or relative where they are going and who they are meeting
meet in a public place
do not rely on the other person for transportation
do not do anything they are not comfortable with
trust their instincts
ask staff for help if they feel uncomfortable

Neurodivergent individuals may have more difficulty making new friends than neurotypical individuals. For example, they may feel uncomfortable maintaining eye contact or engaging in certain other “typical” social behaviors, like small talk.
Some neurodiverse people may want to discuss their neurodivergence when meeting new people. However, others may not feel comfortable doing this, or may not be aware that they are neurodivergent.
Learning about neurodiversity, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , may help people understand themselves or those around them better.
When to speak with a doctor
A person may become lonely if they find it difficult to make friends. This can sometimes affect a person’s mental health.
According to research from 2021 , loneliness is associated with anxiety and depression .
If a person experiences mental health issues linked to loneliness, they may benefit from speaking with a doctor or mental health professional .
A report from 2023 notes that certain therapeutic approaches may help a person experiencing loneliness. These include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and behavioral activation therapy .
