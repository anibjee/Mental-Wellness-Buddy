A Complete Guide to a Digital Detox

Staring at our devices may be pleasurable at the moment, but it can be addictive. You may try digital detox, such as turning off notifications, designating "tech-free" time, and deleting apps.
A digital detox can help anxiety, self-esteem, and sleep. One survey found that nearly one-fifth of people said technology is a source of stress. About 43% of respondents checked their emails, messages, and social media "constantly."
1. Turn Off Push Notifications
Getting constant updates on what's happening in the world is informative, but it can also be distracting. "If you're allowing yourself to get interrupted five times in a half an hour, you're never actually focused in that time," Jesse Fox, PhD , head of the Ohio State University's Virtual Environment, Communication Technology, and Online Research (VECTOR) Lab, told Health . One easy fix is to turn off as many notifications as you can live without.
2. Convert to Black and White
One reason our devices are so alluring is their vibrant colors. Many smartphones now allow you to change the settings so the entire phone appears in grayscale. Removing the vibrant colors can make your phone less pleasurable and reduce screen time.
3. Put Away Your Phone During Meals
It's a common sight at restaurants: a gleaming smartphone next to the bread basket. Research has shown that simply having your phone on the table can reduce the quality of interactions, even if you are not checking it. Your brain is just waiting for it to light up, so you may not be fully present.
"The more energy we direct toward our devices, the less energy we're directing toward whoever is in the room with us," Elisabeth LaMotte , a licensed clinical social worker and founder of the DC Counseling and Psychotherapy Center, told Health .
4. Designate Tech-Free Hours
Many of us feel "naked" when we are without our devices. Taking breaks from technology can support your well-being.
"Start by designating a certain time each day that's tech-free—like while you're eating lunch," said Adam Alter, PhD , author of "Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked." "Then see how you feel after a week or so. Most people feel happy with the change, and they go on to expand it."
5. Make Your Bedroom a No-Tech Zone
"Most people use their phone for an alarm clock," David Greenfield, PhD , assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, told Health . It's easy to start scrolling when you reach for your phone to switch it off. It's best if you can leave your phone out of reach at night and invest in an alarm clock.
Getting cozy in bed with your phone can harm relationships. Make your bed a device-free zone and invite greater opportunities for intimacy and sex.
You will also sleep better. Screens emit blue light , which tricks your brain into thinking it's daytime. The blue light can make it harder to drift off.
6. Rediscover Paper
Reading a book may feel more satisfying than reading a tablet. Books offer fewer distractions. Research has shown you are more efficient and aware than when you are reading on a screen. You may also consider getting your news from a newspaper instead of your phone.
7. Limit Yourself to One Screen at a Time
Your brain may go haywire when you are attempting to work and start scrolling. "Multitasking is really bad for us. If you are focusing on a task and you get distracted—like, oh, I'll just click over to this other window, or I'll just look at this text message—it takes several minutes to recalibrate our brains back to the original task," said Fox.
Make a habit of only looking at one screen at a time. This can improve concentration and, in some cases, enjoyment.
8. Spring Clean Your Social Media Accounts
The more time you spend on social media, the worse you may feel. Research has found that the more time participants spend on Facebook, the poorer their mental health outcomes . This is not surprising, given the fact that we see only a heavily curated version of friends' and celebrities' lives, which can be toxic for self-esteem.
According to Fox, who has studied the impact of social media on society, be proactive about who and what you follow. Clean house from there. Do not be afraid to block, mute, unfollow, or delete until you have created a list of connections who make you laugh and smile and fill you with happiness .
9. Download the Right Apps
Plenty of people feel addicted to their phones, and for good reason. Checking your device activates the reward circuitry in your brain. This triggers your body to release the hormone dopamine , which helps form habits.
It seems counterintuitive, but these apps can actually help you reduce your digital consumption. Freedom lets you block whatever sites distract you on your mobile device or computer, with the goal of helping you focus. Off-Time (available on Android) allows you to selectively block calls, texts, and notifications. The iPhone's "Do Not Disturb" setting offers a similar service.
10. Protect Your Body
Adolescents spend an average of nine hours on devices with digital screens. This can cause digital eye strain, which can cause dryness, blurred vision , and headaches.
Follow the 20-20-20 rule to avoid eye strain: After 20 minutes of looking at a screen, look up at an object 20 feet in the distance for 20 seconds. Do not forget to blink.
Remember to also take frequent breaks from your phone. Too much texting can cause "text neck" and "smartphone thumb." Hold your phone higher so you can look at it straight on and avoid inflammation, irritation, and pain to avoid bending your neck. Mix up the way you type, and use different fingers to avoid thumb pain.
A Quick Review
You may find yourself checking your emails, messages, and social media too often. A digital detox can help improve your sleep, posture, and self-esteem.
Try turning off notifications, designating "tech-free" time, and deleting apps. It's also important to set your devices aside a couple of hours before bedtime. Avoiding blue light at nighttime can improve sleep quality and quantity.
