What is mindfulness?
Mindfulness is a Buddhist teaching that involves deepening one’s awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, and sensations. It can also include observing aspects of the environment, such as sounds, smells, and objects.
Additionally, mindfulness is part of modern psychotherapy approaches, including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) .
How mindfulness helps
Many people find mindfulness beneficial to their overall well-being. It can positively impact their mental, emotional, and physical health.
Mindfulness practices may help people become more perceptive of themselves and their environment. They can use mindfulness as a tool to develop focus, concentration, and mental clarity. This may enhance their work, academics, or athletic performance .
Research shows that self-reflection may encourage self-concept development. This is when a person experiences personal growth by observing or analyzing themselves.
On a physical level, practicing mindfulness may promote relaxation and pain reduction .
According to a 2021 systematic review , mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions may be useful in reducing blood pressure. However, the review only focused on research conducted on people with hypertension, so this may only be true for people with existing high blood pressure.
Mindfulness may also reduce potentially harmful habits, including poor sleep, unhealthy eating patterns, and the harmful use of substances.
Benefits of mindfulness for mental well-being
Mindfulness practices can have a positive effect on mental well-being and can help people develop healthy thought patterns.
Practicing mindfulness may help people learn how to avoid getting stuck in negative thought patterns. This can help improve their mood and feel better overall.
By becoming more mindful, people can learn to let go of the past and not worry about the future. This allows them to be more present, which can reduce stress and worry.
Being mindful may also reduce some symptoms of anxiety and depression.
According to a small 2019 study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience , people who practiced focusing attention meditation and open monitoring meditation experienced positive effects on their anxiety, depression, and rumination. The meditation practices also improved their mindfulness and emotional states.
Through mindfulness practices, people may learn to better regulate their emotions. They may also become more calm, patient, and empathetic.
How to practice mindfulness
Mindfulness practices involve regulating thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. While mindfulness can be a structured practice, it can also involve taking a moment to check in with oneself during a busy day.
People can practice mindfulness through in-person classes, apps , and online classes. They should choose whichever option works best for them.
It can be difficult to start a mindfulness practice, but setting aside a dedicated time and place may help. People can dedicate a quiet, calm area to their practice, as space allows. This space can serve as a trigger to focus on calm and self-awareness.
The space should be free of distractions, including technology. The space should also include a comfortable place to sit or lie down and can include items, such as plants, candles, or cushions.
